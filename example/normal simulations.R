### How to use this code
# Before anything else, install and load the package "mixfdr" from CRAN
# and source in "normal mixture.R"
# Suppose you have observations z
# Note that z is assumed to have sampling variance 1
# We want to get fdr estimates and effect size estimates
#
# First fit a mixture model to z ("mixFdr"). This has effect size
# estimates and fdrs for the z's. It also has parameter estimates for the model.

# If you need estimates for other points (like new data, or to plot)
# effectSize gives posterior mean, variance estimates
# fdrMixModel gives fdr estimates
# all of these work on some vector of values (new or old Z's)
# and need a fitted model for parameters

# more details are in the mixfdr package help.

# Example:
# We want to fit a mixture model with 
# J = 3 groups
# and the theoretical null

# the code to do this is
require(mixfdr)
 set.seed(100)
 z = c(rnorm(1000), rnorm(100,3,1)) # some example
 m = mixFdr(z, J = 2, theonull = TRUE)
 delta = m$effectSize
 varDelta = m$effectPostVar
 fdrs = m$fdr
# there are many more options - see the function mixmodel in "normal mixture" for details 
 
# Suppose we wanted fdr and effect size curves
# then we could do

 s = seq(-5,5,by=0.01)
 effCurve = effectSize(s,m)[,1]
 fdrCurve = fdrMixModel(s,m,abs(m$mu - m$mu[1])<=0.2) # this tells it which indices to consider null

# compare to the Bayes estimator for this problem
 mTrue = list(pi = c(10,1)/11, mu = c(0,3), sig = c(1,1))
# note that the model parameters are in terms of the MARGINAL not of the prior
 trueEff = effectSize(s,mTrue)[,1]
 trueFdr = fdrMixModel(s,mTrue,c(TRUE,FALSE))
 par(mfrow = c(2,1))
 plot(s, trueEff, t = 'l', main = "Effect Size - Black is true", xlab = "z", ylab = "E(delta|z)", ylim = c(-3,3))
 lines(s, effCurve, col = 2)
 plot(s, trueFdr, t = 'l', main = "fdr - Black is true", xlab = "z", ylab = "fdr", ylim = c(0,1))
 lines(s, fdrCurve, col = 2)
 
 ### simulation script

# the mixture model fitting code is fairly quick
# but each call to mixFdr tries a bunch of starts
# and the simulation is kind of large
# so this can still take a while to run...
#
# the paper's simulation results are saved in "oneSidedUnifEff.Rdata"
# and in the file "twoSidedUnifEff.Rdata""

## effect size
# source in simulationstuff.R
library(EbayesThresh)
resOneSided = simulation1full()
resTwoSided = simulation1full(twosided = TRUE)
# or load them in

# mean squared error tables
table1ebayess(resOneSided)
table1ebayess(resTwoSided)

# relative error assessment
library(abind)
restogether = abind(resOneSided, resTwoSided, along = 2)
table2ebayess(restogether)

# you can also get the individual inefficiency tables
# with for example
# table2ebayess(restogether[,1:4,,]) for the one sided case
